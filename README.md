# qhd-simulations

Numerical experiments and simulations related to **Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD)** and quantum-inspired time evolution, implemented in **Python** (with PennyLane where relevant).

## What’s inside
- Core simulation code in `src/`
- Scripts/experiments used to generate key numerical results for the project

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+ recommended
- Typical dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib (and pennylane if used in the experiments)

## Quick start
Clone the repository and run the main entry scripts in `src/` (see inline comments / headers).

## Notes
This repository is intended as a research codebase; scripts may reflect ongoing thesis work and are documented progressively.
